INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Note: the 'ylastic-costagent' program must be installed from CPAN.  

The app-ylastic-costagent git repository is not designed for direct
installation.  It contains an incomplete version of ylastic-costagent that is
compiled and released using the awesome Dist::Zilla tool (http://dzil.org).

(Think about it like this: dzil 'compiles' the repository into a tarball
for release to CPAN.  If you are an end-user, you want the code from CPAN,
not the repo.)

STEP 1 - Install App::Ylastic::CostAgent from CPAN

Install App::Ylastic::CostAgent using your regular CPAN client or distribution
package manager (if available). You may need the OpenSSL development libraries
installed if you don't already have SSL working.

If you aren't sure how to configure a CPAN client, see this excellent post on
using CPAN as a non-root user: http://goo.gl/j27IB 

For example, assuming Ubuntu Linux and a bash shell:

  $ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
  $ curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - -l ~/perl5 App::cpanminus local::lib
  $ eval `perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib`
  $ echo 'eval `perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib`' >> ~/.bashrc
  $ cpanm App::Ylastic::CostAgent

STEP 2 - Write a configuration file

The ylastic-costagent program requires a configuration file that specifies your
Ylastic and AWS account data. The file is 'INI' format. Here is a template:

   ylastic_id = 1234567890abdcef1234567890abcdef12345678
 
   [1234-5689-0123]
   user = foo@example.com
   pass = trustno1
 
   [4321-9865-3210]
   user = foo@example.com
   pass = trustno1

Each Amazon account should be listed as a separate section with the account ID
number in brackets. (You may omit dashes if you wish.)

STEP 3 - Schedule ylastic-costagent as a cron job

The ylastic-costagent program should be run regularly to keep your usage data
current on Ylastic. Here is an example cron job entry that updates usage data
every 12 hours:

   0 */12 * * * /path/to/ylastic-costagent -s user /path/to/config.ini

The -s user option will log to the user facility of syslogd.

If you use a local perl library, be sure to add an appropriate PERL5LIB to your
crontab file, e.g.:

   PERL5LIB=$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5/i686-linux:$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5

Look at the PERL5LIB set by local::lib for the right paths to use.
